This is my movie Trivia Game featuring Nathan's pick!

## About This Git
This Trivia game is about the developer's personal choice of movies. The questions might be hard if you have never seen the movie before. In that case, think of this as a recommendation list. Try your luck, watch the movies and then try again for a better score! There's plenty of genres covered and there is a quick snippet of the developer's thoughts on the movie, after each question.

This Trivia game was created to display my ability to transition pages and use timers to control user expierence.
